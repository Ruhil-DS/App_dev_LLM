# LangChain Learning Module - 1 

This file contains my LangChain Learning Module for the App Development

There are multiple files, dealing with various topics in the context of LLM

I am using LangChain with Gemini APIs

The repo deals with the following concepts:
- Models
- Prompts
- Parsers
- Memory
- Chains
- Question and Answer with LLM using LangChain
- Evaluating the responses provided by LLM
- Agents and using tools in LangChain


## Additional Points
- During the learning module, I came across THREE bugs: 2 in the langChain module and 1 in the Google's API
- I have opened the issues on the official LangChain as well as Google AI's Repo

1. [Google's AI Mode's Safety Rating Mechanism faulty](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-python/issues/258)
1. [LangChain's VectoreStoreIndex not working as expected with Google APIs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/19781)
1. [LangChain's Wikipedia Tool not working as expected in Agents: Google API](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/19805)
