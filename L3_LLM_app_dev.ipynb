    "At YouTube, we are working to provide people with more access to quality health information and help creators reach more audiences. Our AI-powered dubbing tool, Aloud, streamlines the video translation and dubbing process at no cost, helping bridge that gap for creators. The tool has allowed institutions, such as Mass General Brigham, to dub first-aid videos from English into Spanish, providing potentially life-saving information to more people. Now they are expanding their efforts to include videos related to chronic conditions, like COPD and cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also working to break down language barriers to bring more helpful information to health professionals. Starting today, a new animation-style course on the Stanford Medicine Continuing Medical Education YouTube channel will be available in Spanish for free. The course, which helps health professionals recognize and address implicit bias in clinical practice to better advocate for patients from underrepresented and underserved communities, was translated and dubbed using Aloud and is bridging the language gap to ultimately reach more individuals with this crucial knowledge.\n",

Building on Google’s AI expertise, Fitbit Labs can help you get a fuller understanding of your health data and connect the dots across that information. You will be able to ask questions in a natural way and create charts just for you to help you understand your own data better. For example, you could dig deeper into how many active zone minutes \\(AZMs\\) you get and the correlation with how restorative your sleep is.\n",
